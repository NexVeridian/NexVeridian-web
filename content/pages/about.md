I finished a BAS in Software Development in June 2024, I'll be starting a Master's of Computer Science at UT Austin in September 2025. I'm looking for Software Engineering positions, preferably in Rust. I live in Seattle WA, I'm a US citizen.

I've contributed multiple substantial code PRs to JupyterLab and Loco.rs, created an official extension for Loco.rs adding OpenAPI integration, and I have several open source projects on my resume. My strongest programming languages: Rust, TypeScript, Python, and I also use Nix for a lot of my projects.
