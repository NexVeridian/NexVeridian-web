I recently finished BAS in Software Development. I'm looking for Software Engineering positions, I live in Seattle WA, I'm a US citizen. I've contributed multiple substantial code PRs to JupyterLab and Loco.rs. Including creating an official extension for Loco.rs adding OpenAPI integration. I have several open source projects on my resume. My strongest programming languages are: Rust, TypeScript, Python, and I also use Nix for a lot of my projects.
